        <h3>A little of my past, present, and future</h3>
        <p>I studied electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. After graduating in 2012, I went into management consulting, where I built predictive models for fast moving consumer good (FMCG) companies. After discovering consulting was not for me, I wanted to get back into tech. I joined the engineering team at HourlyNerd (now Catalant) in the winter of 2014. In the one years time that I spent with the engineering team at Hourlynerd I learned more than the multiple years I spent consulting. I was eager and ambitious. I venutred into buliding a product of my own in the real estate industry. From early 2016 to Summer of 2016 I worked with two other MIT students to build Transparent. Unfortunately, the real estate startup never caught traction with accelerators. Since the summer of 2016 I have been tinkering on other projects of mine and trying to discover what is next on this crasy ride called life. </p>

        <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, bring active, and solving puzzles. In the past few months I have read "The Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini, the "Underground Railroad" by Colson Whitehead, and in the process of reading "A Little Life" by Hanya Yanagihara. I also regularly play waterpolo and swim. I plan to compete with the peruvian water polo team this upcoming year. Challenging myself mentally is another pass time I attempt on a constant basis. From daily new york times crosswords to solving project euler problems, I try to challenge my mind and keep it nimble. </p>

        <p>I also volunteer and do aspire to make a difference in this world. This upcoming year I plan to learn how to play guitar and start composing mixes of my own, perhaps even DJ a little. </p>
